# Prosthetic_Vision_with_Unity

This repository is based on [Prosthetic-Vision-Render](https://github.com/DoranLyong/Prosthetic-Vision-Render) and [TCP-tutorial](https://github.com/DoranLyong/TCP_tutorial/tree/master/Python_Unity_imageStream(ver2)).

<br/>

This project is built to construct an study environment for prosthetic vision research. The generated phosephene images are transmitted to Unity with TCP and projected on your VR device.
